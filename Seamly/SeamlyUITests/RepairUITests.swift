/// design's own entry, rather than a route through Review.
///
/// **Only the seam path is covered here, and that is a limit of the seed, not an oversight.**
/// `DebugSeed` writes one flagged seam, a confident zero-inset chrome measurement on every
/// keyframe, and no segment breaks — so `Capture.findings` yields exactly one finding, of kind
/// `.seam`. The queue's `.bars` and `.gap` branches are therefore unreachable from any UI test
/// until a second seed variant exists, and inventing one was out of scope for the task that
/// wrote these tests. That seed shape is deliberate: `DebugSeed.seed()` explains why unresolved
/// chrome would outrank the flagged join and hide the very text this seed exists to exercise.
/// Those two branches are covered at the model level instead, by `RepairQueueModelTests`
/// (`answeringNoBarsClearsTheFinding`, `acceptNoBarsPreservesTheConfidentEdge`,
/// `aBarsAnswerReachesTheManifest`) — which is real coverage of the answer reaching the
/// manifest, but not of the taps that get there.
